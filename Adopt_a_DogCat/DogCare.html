            <tr class="dg">
              <th colspan="2">Caring for Your Dog</th>
            </tr>
            <tr class="dg">
              <td>1.</td>
              <td>Feeding: A well-balanced and nutritious diet is essential for your dog's health and wellbeing. Choose a high-quality dog food that meets their nutritional needs and avoid giving them table scraps or human food, which can upset their stomach and lead to health problems.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr class="dg">
              <td>2.</td>
              <td>Exercise: Regular exercise is important for keeping your dog healthy and happy. Take your dog for daily walks or runs, and provide them with plenty of opportunities to play and explore. This can also help to prevent behavior problems that can arise from boredom and lack of stimulation.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr class="dg">
              <td>3.</td>
              <td>Grooming: Regular grooming can help to keep your dog's coat healthy and free of tangles and matting. Brush your dog's fur regularly, and bathe them as needed. It's also important to trim your dog's nails and clean their ears to prevent infection and discomfort.</td>
            </tr >
            <tr class="dg">
              <td>4.</td>
              <td>Health care: Regular visits to the vet are important for ensuring your dog's overall health and preventing any potential health problems. Make sure your dog is up-to-date on their vaccinations, and keep an eye out for any signs of illness or injury.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr class="dg">
              <td>5.</td>
              <td>Training: Proper training and socialization are essential for ensuring your dog is well-behaved and able to interact with other animals and people. Consider enrolling your dog in obedience classes or working with a professional trainer to help them learn basic commands and social skills.</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
